The two months I spent in India was a blessing a curse. I knew I was experiencing
something that I would never fully be able to communicate to another human being.
I just had to submit to it. Standing in front of a 4 story tell blue status of Shiva 
I was overwhelmed knowing this. Walking through a 2000 year old underground marketplace,
the experience was just too powerful.
