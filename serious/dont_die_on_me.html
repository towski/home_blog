<center><h2>Don't Die on Me</h2></center>

<p>
Life is what separates us from robots. It's also the main metric humans
have for determining what is important. Science is great, but life is alive. 
It changes every day. Systems that are supposedly well understood are in
fact infinitely nuianced. If you have explored the world, then
you have seen this. Perhaps one day the internet will provide the rich
experience of life, but for now we are psychologically dependant
on the depth of real world experience. We are eternally
jumping to the next opportunity, just to keep ourselves alive. 
If you don't learn to hop, you are in danger of being buried alive. 
</p>

<p>
So you have one goal in life. And that is to find things that are
alive. They are the only places where you will find good opportunities. The only places
you will experience true joy, not just hollow pleasure. As a human,
you cannot feel joy while surrounded by dead things. And merely being
a human does not make you alive. You may begin to feel like you're surrounded by
robots. The people you know may be trapped in a repetitive sequence. 
The only way to break out is to force yourself to find a new environment. 
</p>

<p>
I decided when I was younger that I wasn't going to turn my head away from the 
incredibly vivid reality in the world. I was no longer comfortable living in the beautiful but mechanical
world of entertainment, and realized the real world had much more entertainment value.
It's also much more directly interactive. There is no lag. 
I came to ignore anyone that was encouraging me to not think or experience things
for myself. I sought out places that are informationally dense. And preferably
before they are strip mined for information and left desolate and homogeneous. 
</p>

<p>
You can tell when a tourist trap is just a facade. A testament
to something that is already dead. I am looking for living systems. 
It's like a drug to experience the world deeply. And it's disappointing to realize that a lot
of it is redundant, or a facade. You have to really experience to tell if a place is
actually meaningful, or if people are just getting drunk.
You need to personally distinguish between the living and the dead.
</p>

<p>
No matter what, you haven't been everywhere and seen everything. 
And often, by the time word gets to the internet, the life
of something is already gone. All the joy that animated it's spirit,
is so easily trampled by the masses. The human world is even more fragile
that the natural world. Think of the beautiful buildings 
full of the memories of hundreds of deep souls, that have all been torn
down, lost forever. Doors closed to all humans. 
Living things change every day. You have to see them up close to 
really understand them. 
</p>

<p>
If you find the next unexploited place, you will find the 
opportunities you are looking for. That twinge of mystery. The happy
strangers. Human society is like a national park. There is a rush to
find and explore the great parts, but there should be more effort to preserve them. 
Similarly, don't break other peoples hearts, or they will become damaged. 
It's inevitable that love will die, and hopefully be reborn. But do you really
want to be the one destroying it? For money? For quick pleasure? 
It is the difference between being alive, and dying. In some way, we all 
need to experience life to stay alive. But I believe those experiences
can be shared, and not simply consumed.
</p>

<p>
It can be destructive to submit yourself to the true force of reality. 
Because the world is also a hostile and terrible place. 
I do see the value of hiding behind a huge wall and a pile
of money, shutting yourself in and submitting to Netflix and Skyrim. But it is a
tragedy to have never experiences the deepest and most sublime life affirming
experiences that this world has to offer. 
Perhaps I'm old fashioned for being personally devoted to this lifestyle. 
</p>

<p>
I've also paid a terrible price for wanting to see and understand everything personally. 
I have aged. I have scars. I have spent hours and hours contemplating if it's really worth
it. After all, hasn't the internet made knowing things personally obsolete? 
I do get a deep satisfaction from personally understanding
the world as fully as is possible. I began to realize that no amount of abstraction
or imagery would ever fully do the world justice
</p>

<p>
It's impossible to fully communicate the beauty of finding the untrampled
wonders of human society. They seem to ring with their importance. If 
you ask me, I can give you a list of places I've found that have a deep 
sense of meaning. But no amount of photographs will take you there.
The sublimeness comes from actually being there, and sucking it in. 
It's up to you to decide if the brochure is a lie. Whether it's fantasy or reality.
</p>

<p>
I'm only 30, but I feel like the human equivalent of a blown speaker. 
I have a hard time adapting back to a fantasy world after having felt the world so deeply. 
I am sometimes discouraged by a lack of curiosity in other people. 
The Wired world still seems somewhat lifeless to me, although I am getting accustomed to it.  
Just as television or movies can't truly offer you the feeling of being there. They
always leave out steps. And it's these steps that are important for truly understanding.
Sometimes finding people who share my perspective can be few and far between. 
But more often than not, people seem to have seen nothing. Felt nothing. 
Understood nothing. 
</p>

<p>
So my advice for you is to always seek out life. You may come from a land of soulless
desolation, but I assure you there are pockets of life in the world. Some are documented
and destroyed. Closed after several years of magic. As a human, it is your imperative. 
We can always change faster than the forces that might trap us, so stay one step ahead.
</p>
<p>
Live everywhere, but you may not like what you see. 
Choose places that you know nothing about, and what you find will be unexpected.
Explore them.  A person can only ever scratch the surface of the gigantic human reality. 
Don't be someone who waits your whole life, find your own story to tell. You will
find that the world is nothing like you expected from anything, especially movies. 
So form your own opinions about places and people. Because only then will you truly understand.
