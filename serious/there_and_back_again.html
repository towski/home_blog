<h1>There and Back Again</h1>
<h2>A brief history of the last 10 years</h2>

<p>I'm gazing into the fire at my cozy home, having just finished watching the Lord of the Rings 
trilogy for the first time, and I am feeling somewhat like I'm back in the Shire. 
I too have seen into the fiery mountain first hand myself. 
But what does adventure mean in the modern world? With the pervasiveness of the internet
now, it can feel like there is no adventure. And that maybe people
aren't taking the time to live their own adventure anymore. Meanwhile
people are increasingly drawn to fantasy and escapes. Video games. 
Certainly there must still be a way to capture that same spirit but in reality?
But instead of a magic ring, alcohol and youth will suffice. Things we cling
to despite our own destruction.
If my twenties are a testament to anything, then it's trying to be Frodo Baggins,
but in real life.
My twenties have been as much a thrill as I could have bargained for,
</p>

<p>
The precursor to my own roaring 20s was rather dire. The anxiety of my final year of college
was compounded by cancer. This had a very negative affect on my sanity. 
I tried to continue with school, and work, and job searching, 
all while wanting to die of chemo.
I had to quit my job. I didn't even show up to one of my finals.
I had failed interviews at Apple and Google. My mind was basically chaos.
</p>

<p>
But I emerged this period cautiously cured and in a place of startling beauty. 
I managed to land a job in LA, and I soon discovered that Los Angeles was a city of dreams. 
The future was going to burst for me and every day I felt it more and more. I got a steady girlfriend. 
And all around me the world popped with color, flavor and sound. It was all so 
reassuring. It was during this time that my experiences started to feel very real. 
Very deep. Very moving. Friday nights at the discotheque. Incredible music shows. 
My trusty blackberry and digital camera. 
</p>

<p>
Experiencing very real things became the goal of my life. Sucking it all in, everything
was beautiful and nothing hurt. My reality did not need amplification. I became, as I feel all
young people should be, a sponge. The boring structure of college and high school was
exposed as an utter sham. Anything goes. Everything goes. Everyone understands. Everyone
is your friend. I opened my heart to the world. Also to look down unexpected alleys. 
I was walking down an oddly charming alley in Chinatown LA, when I found a group
of people gathered in a basement for a book reading.  
</p>

<p>
I suppose given the sudden changes that have occurred in my life, it was only natural what
came next. To jump from the jungle into the desert. Me in all my infinite
openness, took a better job and relocated to Chicago. Los Angeles had gooped me up so good
that I now felt ready to charge the world. Amazingly, my job in Chicago also involved 2
month training in India, with people from around the world. So in the name of exploration
I set forth. To expose myself further to the tempest of the world. In LA I had learned that it was okay to 
step out from behind the curtain. Go dancing. The world would smile with you. 
</p>

<p>
Well India was a jewel. But also the biggest mind fuck ever. I loved every bit of chaotic contrast 
to the Western world. 
Their entire world is seemingly built on different principles than my brain could comprehend.
And I've been shown to love that. I love how there is no one way to build a society.
It's intoxicating to see all the walls you find so rigid in your own society, 
completely broken down and rearranged. It makes you question anyone who staunchly
advocates their own way of life. Of course, I haven't even begun to explore what it
means to be American. 
</p>

<p>
I came back
to Chicago with a crazed look in my eye, describing the wonder of India to my new friends. However
something didn't quite jive in Chicago. People seemed less interested in my brand of 
optimism. The things that worked like a charm in LA, fell flat. Sometimes talking to
people was like talking to a unmoving door. There seemed to be pessimism afoot. 
And the business world I was seeing didn't really reassure me in the way that a good
music performance could. There could not have been a more brutal contrast. 
My job also saw me flying around to San Antonio, and Boston, and Portland. So I sampled
the texas bbq, felt the Boston humidity and got to see Portland again.
</p>

<p>
No surprise that I only lasted a year there. I was left in ruins, but thankfully given a new opportunity
to live in Portland. Having visited Portland a few times before, I welcomed the opportunity, since
I found the place quite charming, yet also quite different from my Southern Californian emergence. 
Portland is a dream. It has changed so gradually that even aspects of the 1950s seem remarkable
intact.
</p>

<p>
And then San Francisco. The only way to describe San Francisco is this: You know
how you have those friends that dress exactly like the catalogue? They think that things
like how to dress is a solved problem? Admittedly, they must have something they 
are passionate about. But to me it seems that most of their feelings are subverted somehow. 
All the rough edges are kept in check. Nothing wild or interesting can really survive here.
I much prefer an anything goes attitude, nothing packaged, nothing borrowed. But
still, there is an appeal to having things in boxes and packages, and maybe putting
your effort into something else. Perhaps all the personality of San Francisco
has been sucked into the internet.
</p>

<p>
So where am I now? Well, still struggling to make sense of it all. How to reconcile, Chicago,
India, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, New York, in my own mind. And perhaps bigger
than all these places, in the internet. That seemingly rapidly growing invisible land mass 
that seems to fill all our minds these days. I have spent lots of time there, yet it still
doesn't feel like a real place.
</p>

<p>Well in reality, the most amazing and real things that I've ever seen have been in person. There's
no escaping that distance. But reality is not just a luxury. But it is disappearing. And if
I write about the last 10 years and don't mention the internet, I guess it's because the internet
lacks the reality of everything else. Even when I was in the thick of the internet.
