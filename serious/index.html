One day the youths of the world will clamber out of their Pokemon induced trance and want to
know what really happened. How things really are. Perhaps it's only a lucky few that actually
peek behind the curtain and watch the actors bicker. To me that's
the more interesting part of life. Not what people say but what they do.
How do they really feel. A facade is a lie that you get caught believing.
Be it now or later.
