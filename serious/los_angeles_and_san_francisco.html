<h4>Los Angeles and San Francisco</h4>

<p>This past year one of my personal heroes passed away. A man whose enormous personality and endless curiosity
inspired many Californians. I'm talking about Huell Howser. </p>

<p>2 years ago I came to my own personal limits. I was 28. My endless optimism as a world explorer took a serious blow. 
I came to realize that the world is a more hostile place than I ever imagined. Growing up in California, you get the 
impression that the world is perfectly. It was very difficult for me to accept that I couldn't be a child of the world.
I couldn't love everything, and everyone.  The world is too prickly, and picky. The are inconsistencies. 
There are just too many problems in the places I've been. 
world that I could live permanently. I only began to appreciate how California </p>

<p>California is the most optimistic and advanced place in the world. 
Many of the worlds energies are focused singularly on this one place, with many charms and beauties.
And I only say this as I've come to appreciate it much more. I have done my time opening my eyes
to the rest of the world, and I am now content to be my home. I thought that I would endlessly see
and explore, and perhaps end up in some unknown reach. But the more I explored, the more I came
to realize that no place will ever replace California as my home.
</p>

<p>California, with it's mere 36 million population and curious geography, could not hold a bigger
hold on the rest of the world. The world waits on edge for the latest technology from the Bay
Area. And the seat of human dreams for the last 50 years sits patiently in Los Angeles.
Strictly speaking, there is no place in the world with such an inordinate amount of impact on the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>California has two great cities, and if you want to understand California, you need to spend
a good amount of time in both of them. North and South.  </p>

<p>So I think the task of understanding California is the foremost interest of our age. All 
humans under the earth should be allowed to bask under it's sun, experience the , and profit
from it's technological advances. 
</p>

<p>The internet has opened access of most things up to anyone with a connection. It has equilized the world.
Still, there is a great importance in place. Techies flock to San Francisco.

<p>Within my own mind, I have set about trying to bridge this gap. This divide. It is almost as 
broad as the gap between the two halves of the brain. 

I just drove up from LA to SF, for the umpteenth time. I hooked my phone into an old cassette adapter
for the first time and had a 6 hour long mix of all my favorite Spotify tracks.
It made the trip very seamless. I'm told that soon automatic driving cars will fill this corridor.
The central valley in between felt like a grey wasteland, but the music made the trip easy. 
Spotify is easily my favorite music technology, given the incredible ability that I can listen
to almost anything from it's huge catalog, almost anywhere. It has allowed
With my custom electric
bicycle strapped to the back, I am with many of my favorite things. I love technology. And that's
perhaps the reason why I'm driving back to San Francisco. I grew outside Los Angeles, and I absolutely
love it down there. </p>

<p>Los Angeles is a part of me, and it impacts my feelings about technology and cities deeply. It has
also shown me things that I would not have believed possible. And having seen more than my fair 
share of the world, it . Technology is just the instrument. Humans are always the content. 


<p>It's perhaps because of Los Angeles that I am always given to seeing and hearing more. It
has whet my curiosity quite thoroughly for everything. So maybe it's in my DNA, but I love
explore every possible, drink, type of food, and especially music. Don't be obsessed with your
own culture. It is but one drop in a bucket. And while America is still the world's hot shot,
Los Angeles only thrives because it puts it's own culture second. Perhaps it's just hospitality,
but I would almost always prefer to hear someone else's experience. </p>
The main reason I write this is to share my love of Los Angeles, so that you may possibly also better 
understand me. 
I feel like it's the one place I 
would to show anyone. . 
in the world right now, and I'm incredibly proud to be both from California, and living there. And I wish
I would meet more people who have my experience, of both living in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Because living
in Los Angeles probably changed me more than anywhere else in the world. And I think people everywhere can
benefit from the Los Angeles perspective, if only because of it's multiculturalism. </p>


<p>Sometimes people up here seem shocked that I speak so fondly of Los Angeles. Sure, I grew up around there,
but I didn't live in Los Angeles until I was 22, and only lived there a year. Still, compared to the 
other places I've lived (Chicago and Portland), Los Angeles impressed me the most. No where in the world
do I feel more comfortable than at Spaceland (aka The Satellite), or La Cita bar downtown. Everything is
so cozy down there, and I find most of the regulars to be very easy to talk to.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is a very outward looking place. It seeks to bring the world to it, like SF or NY, but it does
it in a different way. Since LA is so dynamic, it doesn't really force people to conform to it. LA is 
very interested in . Probably because of it's show business roots, LA wants to see people who are different. 
And maybe some people aren't. I was born different, so I instantly connect with Los Angeles. </p>

<p>It's also a very emotional human place. I think LA can be misunderstood as simply
a series of freeways. But driving is what gives you access to more than almost anywhere else in the world.
It allows businesses to open in a relatively broad area. And keeps rents from rising. </p>

<p>I think it's for that reason that I'm constantly comparing the two cities. A tale of two cities if you will.
My interest only increased each time I hear someone from SF talk about LA. My opinion on the matter is pretty
versed at this point, and I love to share my own personal love for Los Angeles. It's such an easy city
to get around, with endlessly rewarding experiences. </p>

<p>Comparing two cities involves many many data points. In some ways, cities are the ultimate data stores. And
while I appreciate hard data, the human mind has ways of figuring out patterns without needing all the data. 
Simply spending time in a city is enough for your mind to collect data</p>

<p>I have a hard time comparing the two cities, mostly because one city is so emotionally charged and personal,
and the other city is impersonal and unemotional. To simply apply data to that would ignore the actual impact
that both cities have had on me. One city is an intellectual center. The other is not as obsessed with . It's
more fluid and dynamic. One is obsessed with data. The other is obsessed with feeling. One loves money, the
other seems to love people more than money. All of this is hard to explain. </p>

<p>I'm not interested in discussing which is 'better' in various ways. I am mostly alarmed at how 
quickly people are to draw conclusions about anything. Both are obsessed with the next new thing, 
but in different ways. W</p>
