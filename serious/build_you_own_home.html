It's important to build and keep your own home. Because no matter how amazing
your surroundings may be, you will always need a home. A place that is yours. 
I have personally neglected this point until now. I was determined
to make the world my home

It is my opinion that those who seek to order the world, are only seeking to
control it. It is not for our benefit that we live longer. It is a mean thing
to build a fantasy for someone else to live in. You are essentially
filling their mind with garbage, for their benefit. But people are all too
eager to believe the fantasy. Because reality.  Your pretending may initially be a benefit.

You can't trust peoples faces.
