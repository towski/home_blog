The last 2 years of my life have been the worst 2 years of my life. Passion is gone. Joy
is gone. My youthful appearance is gone. I look crazed. And badly beaten. The truth hurts.

Your brain is the nexus between reality and fantasy. And I've realized the importance of both. 
When I was younger, I was heavily into fantasy. Until I realized that fantasy couldn't satisy
all aspects of my life. So I reacted and become heavily reality. I had to deal with cancer,

Simultaneously, the stream of my youth had largely evaporated by the time I reached
28, and I was reaching my limits. 28 might not seem that old, but
I suspect and have heard, that right around that time a lot of people start to dry up. 
Their dreams start to seem like enormous closed gates. Maybe it's a biological fact. I
n any case, it certainly happened to me. At 28 I got the biggest punch in my gut I had ever had, 
and it forced me to re-evaluate everything I believed.

Well fast forward to year 28 of my life, and suddenly the reality is starting to fade. After a 
break-up with a girlfriend, there didn't seem to be any escape from the crushing reality. I felt 
too old, at least too unhappy to meet another girl to fill my life. And I couldn't pretend I 
wasn't insecure around women I would meet. Too much time around reality and you might suddenly
realize that your chances might not be as good as you expect. If you see the people around
you failing to find love, it can be a rude wake up call. 

But strangely, instead of retreating into fantasy, I found that fantasy wasn't helping my mind. 
I had somehow gotten stuck in reality, and there was no escape. I watched Star Wars 6, and all I 
could think about was how terrible it was. I was turning increasingly to alcohol to try and 
deaden the pain. Of course, that started to get more and more painful, until I lost control of my 
mind completely. I was barely able to program, and my opportunity to escape, moving down to 
San Francisco, was a challenge I was unable to face. 

Although I had managed to keep a good job, and gotten to see the world, I felt like an utter failure. 
Literally everyone around me seemed either too sad, or too happy. And so the ship started sinking. 
I still have a hard time understanding why. On the surface, nothing was really as bad as I felt.
I also suspect that being 28 had something to do with it. My inner fire had gone out. My optimism
for the future, and my desire to see new things was basically zilch. 

I had a work trip down to San Francisco, and I could barely stand to talk to my bubbly sunny
coworkers. I had to retreat, and  If only I could somehow change how I felt. Because my life was about to take a terrible
dive. I lost control of myself, and caused myself the deepest most painful social anxiety. My
social anxiety had already
