In the future, when someone's iphone battery dies, they will be carted out of the restaurant in a straightjacket. 
They will start raving about things that once were, and people will immediately be distressed. 
The facade will be lowered, the reality will be too much to overcome. Instant psychosis. 
It will only affect a small percentage of uberminds that live among us. They will not be perceptibly
different except for their psychotic outbursts during such events. Then you will see
the raw naked brain animal.

There will be an app that causes instant insanity. 

There was a club once. It was nothing special, and that's what made it special. No one paid any attention to it.
There was ectoplasmic residue from all the previous good times that had happened.
