Emotional competency: Using your feelings as a guide

A meaningful existence is a coherent existence. We need to be 
convinced of our own sureness. It can be very emotionally
damaging to go around learning that just about everything
you think you know is wrong. But yet, that is true for everyone.
Because the world is not one single way, no one is ever completely
right. So emotions are how we piece out what is important 
and what isn't. 

Nowadays, the capacity for one's eyes to grew bigger than ones
mouth is exponential. Almost everything that is produced is telling
you that you want more. You need more. More what? The truth is,
you only ever need more feeling. Staring into a stream can be more meaningful
than the endless false promises of business. 

I've been a bit disappointed by people out in the world. It is very common
to abandon this core tenent of existence. That you are what you feel. After all,
feeling is what determines whether or not being rich even matters. If you 
were to learn that rich people are unfeeling, would you still want to be rich?
Feeling is what determines what is significant in our lives. The inability
to discuss or explain that 

It almost seems antiquated for me to say this. It seems like a voice from the past,
reaching out. In the face of the overwhelming mechanization of the human experience,
feelings can seem like a trap. 

My opinion is that feelings are the only way you can tell if something is important. 
So even if everyone around you is telling you something is true, your own 
feelings are your own guide. And if you subvert your own feelings, you will
lose this ability. If you become uncomfortable with your own feelings, you
will lose your only chance to be happy. Because happiness depends on your
own body's ability. 

I don't understand my own feelings. The rationalist in me knows that there's the
frightening possibility that my feelings could be wrong. But the emotions in me
help me realize that the rationalist is out of touch with reality. No amount
of thinking can actually change how you or anyone else feels.   

Society has a suppressive capacity for feeling. It's very apparent in cities. 
Feelings are constantly under attack. To expose your feelings makes you vulnerable.
