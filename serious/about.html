<h3>Impress me. Prove you're human</h3>

<p>Humans can recognize infinite subtlety. When I meet someone new, one of the ways I learn if they're really
human is by the stories they tell. 
I like to meet the ones that have really pushed it. Gone out of their way to see it for themselves.
People with stories. With pasts. </p>

<p>As such, I've basically accumulated a life of exploration that has beat me up terribly. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Cancer &#x2713; </li>
  <li> France &#x2713; </li>
  <li> India &#x2713; </li>
  <li> Start-up &#x2713; </li>
</ul>

<p>Admittedly I didn't get cancer just to brag about it or put it on my bucket list. But going through treatment basically showed me that 
I'd have to do every fucking thing I could when I got the chance.</p>

<p>As such, money has long since </p>
<p>
The ordinary life is boring. But it's not about fucking and drinking your way through the world. 
Loving deeply is not about fucking every woman who will allow you.
That is the fantasy. The 007 life. In reality, James Bond is basically a government murderer. Put him in 
a different government, and the picture is much starker.

I can appreciate subtlety in some things. But not in others. These are the things that 

Watching television is like letting someone shit into my brain. They are desparately wanting me to believe some fantasy of existence. 
The only way to really understand existence, is to see it for yourself. And believe me, you will be fucking horrified by what 
you see. The true meaning of desperation on the faces of the people you see. And you realize that you can't offer them any hope.
This is simply the shape of the world. Some will fail, some will succeed.
