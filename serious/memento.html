<center><h1>Memento</h1></center>
<p>The past 2 years of my life have basically been a low-calorie version of the plot of Memento. 
I've never seen Memento, but I imagine it goes something like this: every
morning you wake up, not knowing who you are, what's going on, or how you got there. It's strange, and it's terrible. Everything that you
thought you knew, or held as important, has been completely destroyed. In the place of everything you thought you understood is a blank space. The world
is a mystery. </p>

<p>There is a benefit in being this way. You see the world in a million different ways.
Inevitably, as people get older, they become attached to a single perspective. The places they've
seen, the people they've known. Before you know it, you're set in your ways. Going to the same bar. In the same city. Drinking the same
thing. I've always pushed myself to escape that. No matter what, we need new experiences. Through television. Through ipads. Or
through reality, the true source of everything. </p>

<p>There is a perverse part of me that has always subjected myself to everything. I want to experience it all before 
I die. I am not content with the reports that people send. There is always something beyond the imagination. 
I want the experience things as they are. Because they will happen, regardless of what I try to do.
Because they're real. And they're inescapable. Reality is a high that nothing else can satisfy. You can't get the same
high with art.  Because the people looking at the art can't comprehend what they're looking
at. They assume that the impossible is not possible.</p>

<p>I've learned that most people don't understand anything about the world around them. They know the correct words to use, they know what they're
supposed to say in a situation. But they don't know why. Or who. Or what. They read the script that they're handed, and the go
on their way. Which works. Up until a point. You start to ask questions. Start to dig deeper. Into what's really going on. It's 
there that you find the truth. The true chaos of reality, that you've always been shielded from. That 
you are surrounded by people that don't suspect a thing about what's happening to them. </p>

<p>But reality, by it's very nature, will always offer you something unexpected. Because there is no end to the real possibilities. Infinity
is just a concept. If
you try and simplify one area, you will only find that another area of complication will spring up in it's place. And I know personally, that these
chaotic zones are the source of all life. The source of all creativity. The source of all joy. There is no joy in playing by the rules. 
You will be astounded by the color and the gravity of the world. But you will also be destroyed, realizing
that everyone else that has come before you was trapped in their own existence.</p>

<p>Therefore I encourage all people of all nationalities, all backgrounds, all bank accounts (except the very rich of course), to see as much of life as they can.
Look between the cracks. Into microscopes. Into peoples eyes. Not because what you will find will be good. But because you have no choice but to accept what
has been given to you. A world that is a certain way. Not as you want it to be. </p>
