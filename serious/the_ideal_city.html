For me the ideal city is the one with the least number of restrictions on what is allowed.

Art seeks the eternal. Technology is simply a chameleon.

Games are false problem solving. There are always problems to be solved. But
people don't recognize. The biggest problem is how to keep everyone happy. 


the problem with the internet is that it is important to observe things from all
angles before making a decision and deciding. but the internet presents the world in 2d. 
and you're encouraged not to look behind the curtain.
