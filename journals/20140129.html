<h1>Wednesday, January 29th</h1>
<p>Got and installed a new hard drive for my computer today. Decided to reinstall debian instead of Ubuntu. It was fun, but I am tired of this basic
stuff. What a hassle. </p>

<p>Actually, I guess it wasn't too bad. It was fun to read directly from the hard drive, trying to salvage data. Even though the hard drive eventually
crashed and I was unable to recreate what I lost, most of it was on github, or my servers. Playing around with Knoppix was fun, reminded me how much I like Debian. I downloaded Knoppix to a DVD so I could use Knoppix64, and I bootstrapped my new Debian install directly onto the hard drive using debootstrap. With debootstrap, you can basically create a debian installation into any directory that you want. Then if you use chroot, your terminal will behave like it's in a separate installation.</p>

<p>The full process was like this: I manually did an fdisk to create one partition on my new hard drive. Then I created an ext4 file system, then ran <a href='https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap'>Debootrap</a> with the options for the unstable Debian. Then I installed grub2 and a linux kernel inside a chrooted environment. With grub-install /dev/sda I was able to install the bootloaded with the kernel, and then boot from the harddrive. I had to add the non-free repository to install firmware for my wireless card with the package firmware-iwlwifi. I then installed gnome desktop, which actually behaves a lot more consistently than Ubuntu Unity, and looks a little nicer.</p>
