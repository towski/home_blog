<h1>Sunday, January 26rd</h1>
<p> My hard drive crashed today, so I spent the next two days trying to do a e2fsck, until finally it became clear
that I couldn't even read larger than 100mb chunks at a time. I lost the code I wrote for my android app, but most everything else
should be fine. Just indicates to me that I need a backup strategy.</p>

<p>Found a cool old humidifier in the street. When I initially used it, my lungs started to hurt. So when I checked the base, I found it was full of gunk and probably
harmful spores. So I scrubbed it a bit, and bought some vinegar to run through it. It smelled like vinegar for a while in the apartment. Which didn't bother me, 
but it did everyone else. Let it run all night, and my mouth wasn't as dry as usual when I woke up. I'm going to call that a victory.</p>
