<p>For some perverse reason I spent most of the day reading the C code for Ruby. I decided to start with the very
first version of ruby code available, 0.49. I had to fix a few basic coding conventions, but got it mostly working.
It's a pretty old version of Ruby, but it was pretty good at showing me the C internals. I thought some stuff
wasn't working, but it's just figuring out what Objects I can create, and why the error output is somewhat broken.</p>

<p>I was interested in learning Go, but I figured I would start with C, since online Go is listed as somewhat C compatible. 
Being an ardent Ruby lover, I was trying to see if I could make ruby more like go. Probably not a simple task,
but it was really fun to learn GDB and dig around in the ruby internals. Seeing how it creates hashes for methods,
and how it goes through the yy nodes, whatever that means. Bison and yak or something?</p>

<p>Went for a walk around the Mission, and actually felt pretty good. Not sure why I am enjoying reading C code
so much. I guess I never really got to take the time to look around at it. And since people seem to think
so lowly of Ruby's concurrency state, I'll probably mess around with Go some eventually. Really I want to 
rewrite Ruby in Go, but I don't even know if that makes sense, since Ruby is already in C. </p>
