<h1>Saturday, January 24rd</h1>

<p>I had a big dream for today. I wanted to share the data from my phone to my computer, so that even if I'm travelling,
my computer can still host this web site through my phones data. This lead me through a few turns, like rooting my phone. And
I also explored doing peer-to-peer from my phone.</p>

<p>
I can't believe I waited so long to root my phone. It basically felt like a rite of passage. An initiation into the world of mobile hacking. 
Suddenly realizing your phone is just another linux machine is pretty fantastic.
I have an HTC One+, and after digging around for a bit, I found instructions
from <a href='http://theunlockr.com/2013/06/23/how-to-root-the-htc-one-x-att/'>Unlockr</a>. For the first step, I needed to 
add some rules to udev so that my computer would talk to my phone properly. After restarting into the boot screen, then I ran the steps
from <a href='http://www.htcdev.com/bootloader'>htcdev</a>. Took a little digging to find the AIO file <a href='http://www.hasoon2000.info/?developer=One%20X%20Plus'>here</a>, which I ran in my Windows Virtual Box. I am amazed at how useful those installations from <a href='https://github.com/xdissent/ievms'>ievms</a> are. Windows handled the usb stuff mostly correctly, and I managed to root my phone, after booting the leet recovery image, it all seemed to work quite normally.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first app I tried, the root tethering app didn't work. I'll have to mess around with it a bit, but I soon distracted 
myself with other magical glories. 
It didn't take me long to concoct some new plans. I chased down an old dream of mine to make 
some peer-to-peer software, and magically came across some UDP-busting code in an old rubyinsider 
<a href='http://www.rubyinside.com/skype-style-firewall-busting-with-ruby-and-udp-399.html'>post</a>. I tested that 
code out between my ec2 and home computer with a random port, and KAPOW, magic peer to peer behind a firewall. 
The real test would be getting it to work between my home computer and my phone.</p>

<p>Burrito break. The weather is just gorgeous in San Francisco, so I biked around until it got dark. Didn't see anything too shocking.</p>

<p>The next question was how to get ruby to run on my phone. Looking for an Android ruby quickly brought up <a href='http://github.com/ruboto/ruboto'>ruboto</a>. I executed the peer-to-peer code through ruboto, and to my initial shock, I was able to send packets from my phone to my home computer, both from behind firewalls. I then made a full fledged ruboto app, with the intention of
allowing a website to snap pictures from my phone whenever they wanted. <p style='text-decoration:line-through'>However, later I discovered the caveat that my phone isn't receiving the data, and that it's maybe <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12359502/udp-hole-punching-not-going-through-on-3g'>not so easy</a> to connect two phones this way. It still seems feasible though, but ofc there is no silver bullet.</p></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Turns out all the peer-to-peer mobile stuff does work. I just needed to play around with it a little more.</p>
