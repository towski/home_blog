<h1>Friday, January 23rd</h1>

<p>
Last night I started taking <a href='http://unicorn.bogomips.org/'>unicorn</a> apart in order 
to add process concurrency for <a href='https://github.com/towski/channels'>channels</a>. The idea is that you should be able to take a bunch of channels (basically threads) and distribute them easily over a number of processes, sporadically writing back to the master. I am basically trying to increase the concurrency of this <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fVxh-BKfEI&feature=youtu.be'>video</a>. That shows about 2000 threads hopping around each with some basic AI. That project is called <a href='https://github.com/towski/dwarf'>Dwarf</a>. 

<p>Took a break from that to bike around for a while. From my apartment in the south of the Mission, got a burrito at Taqueria Farolito on 24th. Which is very quickly becoming
my favorite burrito place, it has a very authentic vibe. The clientele are mostly Mission locals, which I'm coming to appreciate more and more. I biked up Valencia to Market, and it was
quite hazy. At the bay bridge I took this <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/towski/12125387394/'>photo</a>. I went to Starbucks on Bryant, but noticed <a href='http://www.coffeebarsf.com'>Coffee Bar</a> across the street. Jesus that place look like the pinnacle of San Francisco modern cafe design and style. I'll have to go there sometime next week. </p>

<p>Taking unicorn apart and reproducing it lead to <a href='https://gist.github.com/towski/8613240'>this</a>, which can handle about 11,000 communications per second on my 4 cpus, which is probably fine for my purposes. I want each process to be able to handle ~10,000 Threads that are all sporadically writing back to the master. I'll clean that up and put it in dwarf.</p>

<p>Playing around with unicorn also lead to <a href='https://gist.github.com/towski/8613183'>this</a>. It was basically a way to do file sharing in the
browser, using the socket from the uploader to send data to someone who clicks a link. Unfortunately that data gets sent through an ec2 server, which basically means
amazon bandwidth costs. I tried running it locally to file share from my computer, but my ISP slows down the connection a lot, so it's not really worth it as a file
sharing server. Still it was fun to have a socket that intercepts browser requests and very simply forwards sockets. </p> 

<p>Then I also got the idea for hosting my own blog on my own machine, making it easy to hack. It also makes it feel pretty intimate, none of this anonymous web hosting
. Let's just hope that running and publishing nginx on my local machine is safe. I'll have to ask in a security irc channel tomorrow. </p>
