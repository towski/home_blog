<p>Being a programmer is hard. I finally get my dev environment where I want it, and my harddrive crashes. A 2 month old harddrive just
crashes. And all because I bought a linux laptop. This shit doesn't happen on OSX. Put that on my list of things you need to plan for. And
I temporarily changed a few passwords to an older password 
and someone hacks my AWS account. In what is basically a 2 day window. </p>

<p>I've seen everything go wrong in every different way, and not just for me personally. I've seen data center employees accidentally
completely power off your entire rack. I've seen DNS hosts clear all your DNS records, and when you file a support ticket,
they make it worse, so you lose DNS for an entire day. 
</p>

<p>Compared to that, OSX is such a shiny beautiful world. Where everything always works. I'm convinced that everyone at Apple must be on drugs
all the time, in order to ensure that everything always goes right. Because it's simply not the normal world of computing.
</p>
<p>
It's true, programmers have to constantly deaden themselves with alcohol and coffee and weed, just to handle
the chaos. If you hit a few home runs, you may become a member of the technorati, while thousands of schlubs slave
away on the entire open source stack. Someone swoops in to take all the credit. And apparently the billionaires of
Silicon Valley are price-fixing engineer salaries. The pigs have learned to walk.
</p>

<p>Someone has already said this, but it's true. The longer you've been in technology, the more you realize what a shit show it really is.</p>

<p>
So I'm back on Linux. And Linux is basically the gutter compared to OSX. I installed the unstable branch of Debian, only to have my X server totally
destroy it's own config, and become unusable. So now I'm back on Debian stable, but it looks and feels like 5 years ago. Nothing
is sadder than seeing those guys at the coffee shop running those old Linux distributions. Nothing sexy about it. </p>

<p>But at least I can wash my hands of all that insanity. When technology is used to make money, evil knows no bounds. With Linux,
I can rest assured that someone somewhere is still passionate about updating the libc package. They are the real heros in the technology
world. The thousands of regular people who sit in linux irc chat rooms, update linux packages, and generally
focus entirely on the boring shit that we're all too good for. Because let's face it, no matter how big you 
think your contribution is to open source, you're basically pulling a single lever of a million levered juggernaut.
</p>

<p>In life, as in the computer world, you must constantly be failsafing everything. We have to protect ourselves from our own bosses
and their maniacal urges. And turns out, it's not just a localized thing. The people at the very top are manipulative assholes too.
With millions of ways to hide their tracks. I'm starting to think maybe the NSA isn't such a bad thing. 
Maybe they're more like Perry Mason, some of the time. At least the government pretends to have our backs. 
</p>
<p>
Technology is a violent world, and engineers are the people that are preventing
you from seeing all that. 
Engineers who are brilliant at covering their own tracks. 
Someone cut a few wires on my electric bicycle, so now I get to spend the weekend at Radio Shack. For as many
people there are in San Francisco that are excited about technology, there are just as many people agitated about it.
Welcome to the future. </p>
